        <p> I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. 
            I am really into exploring how natural disasters reshape cities across the U.S., from the way people move to how communities bounce back</p>

        <h3>Research Interests</h3>
        <p>My research focuses on the intersection of natural disasters and urban resilience. I investigate how disasters impact city structures, migration patterns, and the recovery process.</p>

        <h3>Current Projects</h3>
        <p>Currently, I am working on a paper that explores city resilience following natural disasters, building on my previous work on disaster-driven migration.</p>
